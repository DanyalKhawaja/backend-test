## Comments
 I spent a day learning about Nest.js and Elastic Search, which are new domains for me. The current work-in-progress took up my entire day to reach this point. However, I still require more time to complete the task. I have already performed numerous frontend, migration, and testing tasks in the production environment, so that won't be an issue for me. However, learning Elasticsearch is a completely new topic for me and has a learning curve.

`yarn start:dev` in backed folder (root)
`yarn start` in front-end folder

Pending build and home page linking with the backend which would be login or home page.
